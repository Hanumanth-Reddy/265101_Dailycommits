# tuples are very similar to lists, except that they are immutable.
# they are crated using parentheses, rather than square brackets.

words = ("spam","eggs","sausages")
print(words[0])

# trying to reassign a value in a tuple causes a TypeError.
# tpl = ()   empty tuple
# tuples are faster  than lists but they cannot be cahnged.
# we can make nested tuples.
